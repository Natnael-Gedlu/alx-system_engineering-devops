0x19-postmortem
Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible 
factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing 
is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must 
learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because 
of the same issue is not.
