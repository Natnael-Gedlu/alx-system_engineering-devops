For every additional element, why you are adding it?
Load balancer: distributes incoming requests equally among the available servers to ensure optimal resource utilization,
high availability, and reliability.
Replica server: in our case adding a replica server is used as a backup incase the Primary server fails.

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?
The load balancer uses a Round Robin distribution algorithm. It distributes incoming requests equally among the
available backend servers in a sequential order, routing requests to each server in turns.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both?
In an Active-Active setup, all nodes are actively serving traffic. This setup provides high availability and even load
distribution across all nodes.
While n an Active-Passive setup, one node is the active node that handles traffic while the passive node remains inactive.
If the active node fails, the passive node takes over.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
A Primary-Replica cluster involves a master node (Primary) and one or more slave nodes (Replicas). The Primary node
manages write operations and coordinates the Replicas. Replicas replicate data from the Primary node and handle read
operations providing fault tolerance and scalability.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
Primary Node: Handles write operations, ensuring consistency and durability of data, and controls the overall state of the database.
Replica Node: Handles read operations, replicates data from the Primary node, and helps in load balancing by serving read
queries, improving performance.

Where are SPOF
In this case the load balancer itself could be a SPOF if it fails, disrupting traffic distribution.
In the Active-Passive setup, failure of the active node leads to downtime until the passive node takes over.

Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)?
Lack of a firewall leaves the infrastructure vulnerable to external threats and unauthorized access.

No monitoring?
Without monitoring, it's challenging to detect and address performance issues, anomalies, or failures, which can lead
to service disruptions and impact user experience.
