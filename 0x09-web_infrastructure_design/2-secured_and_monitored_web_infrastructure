For every additional element, why you are adding it?
Firewalls are added to control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificates are added to enable HTTPS and encrypt data transmission between clients and servers.
Monitoring clients or tools are used to observe and collect performance data from client-side devices or software.

What are firewalls for?
Firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules to protect against
unauthorized access and potential threats.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
Traffic is served over HTTPS for secure and encrypted connections between the client and server, safeguarding sensitive
data from eavesdropping.

What monitoring is used for?
Monitoring is used to observe and analyze system performance, detect issues, and ensure system health and security.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data?
Monitoring tools collect data through agents, logs, or APIs to track system metrics and performance.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS?
Use monitoring tools to set up tracking of Queries Per Second (QPS) metrics, configure the tools to gather performance
data, and create alerts or reports to monitor QPS.

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?
Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes unencrypted data within the internal network, compromising security.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
A single MySQL server for writes is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) – failure could lead to downtime and data integrity issues.

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem?
Because it may lead to vulnerabilities – if one server has a flaw, it affects all, increasing the risk across the infrastructure.
