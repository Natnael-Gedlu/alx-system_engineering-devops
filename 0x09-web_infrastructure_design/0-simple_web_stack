What is a server?
A server is a computer system or software that provides functionality or services to other computers, known as
clients over a network.

What is the role of the domain name?
A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and locate resources on the internet.
It maps to an IP address, allowing users to access websites and services using a memorable name instead of numeric IP addresses.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
The DNS record type for "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME record, which is an alias of another domain's hostname.

What is the role of the web server?
The web server serves web pages or content to users web browsers over the internet. It receives HTTP requests from
clients, retrieves web pages or data, and sends the information back to the client's browser.

What is the role of the application server?
An application server hosts and manages software applications. It handles tasks such as data processing,
application logic, and interaction with the database, ensuring the functionality of the software is carried out properly.

What is the role of the database?
The database stores and manages structured sets of data used by applications. It's responsible for storing, organizing,
and providing access to the data needed by the application.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
The server communicates with the user's computer via the HTTP protocol. This protocol allows the exchange of data between
the web server and the client's browser when requesting and receiving web pages.

Issues with this infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
A SPOF is a critical component within the infrastructure that, if it fails, can lead to the entire system's failure.
For example, if there's only one web server and it goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during maintenance (such as deploying new code):
Deploying new code or performing maintenance may require restarting the web server, resulting in downtime. During this
period, the website might be temporarily unavailable to users.

Inability to scale with high incoming traffic:
If the infrastructure is unable to handle a sudden surge in incoming traffic, the website might become slow or even
inaccessible. Without proper scalability measures, it becomes challenging to accommodate increased user demand without
compromising performance.
